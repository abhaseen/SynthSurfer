# SynthSurfer

A work in progress game in development in the Unreal Engine 4. This is a hoverboard game in which a player plays through a series of levels collecting songs.

The main ideas of this game are:

- Making a functioning skateboarding animation with the board flip on every jump
- Making a working rail grinding system
- Fully functioning AI that'll chase and attack the player
- Making AI's that can launch projectiles that will harm the player
- A collectibles game that involves the player collecting a certain amount of objectives in each level

## Story

The story is about two DJ brothers that have an upcoming show the next night. They have put together a playlist but all of a sudden, they lose their song files in the virtual world. So one of the brothers goes inside to retireve the songs in each level.

## Gameplay Demo

Here is a raw and unedited gameplay of the game in it's current pre-alpha state.
